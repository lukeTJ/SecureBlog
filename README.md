# What Is RBAC
RBAC, or Role-Based Access Control, is a system for managing user access to resources by assigning permissions to predefined roles rather than to individual users. Users are assigned one or more roles, and their permissions are determined by the privileges associated with those roles, such as a Doctor's role granting access to patient records. This model simplifies access management, enhances security by enforcing the principle of least privilege, and aligns with organizational structures, making it a standard in managing access for digital resourad

# Why Is RBAC important to SecureBlogs Security 
By Limiting access to certain parts of the application determined by a role based system making certain parts limited to those roles.

# How should Admin, Author, Editor and Readers differ on the blog
Certain roles should each get different roles for the application as not every role should be able to do what an admin is able to do, this creates security for the application

# One incident where poor or non-existent caused major damage 
A notable IT damage incident caused by poor access control was the GitHub incident in 2022, where a privilege escalation bug allowed unauthorized users to gain higher access levels within repositories, highlighting severe damage to its data security and potentially leading to unauthorized code changes, intellectual property theft, or the introduction of malicious code

# What mistakes would break a blog if RBAC is wrong? For example, anyone can publish or delete. 
Anyone would be able to Delete any blog made and this could be done for malicious entent or if anyone were to be able to make something it would reduce any creditability of the site as anyone would be able to say anything.
